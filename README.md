# File-Processing
***
First exercise for the subject Fundamentals of Database Systems using c++. The objectives of this project are: 

* To create a text file using any PL
* To open an existing text file
* To add data to a text file
* To edit data to a text file
* To delete data to a text file
* To sort data to a text file
* To filter data to a text file


## Creating a text file


<!-- add image typing hehe -->
 After hitting the enter button, it will create a text file called hehe.txt
 <!---
 Add image of directory text file
-->

 ## Opening An Existing Text File
 ***
 After creating the file you can now open it. 
 As you can see, when trying to open an existing file, it will display all the files and folders in your current directory.
 As you can see, since we just created the file earlier, it says that there is no data currently. 
 <!-- add image showing no data currently-->
 
I already created an existing file called sample.txt that has data in it so we can try to open it.

  After opening a file that has data inside it, it will display the contents of the file like this.

Since it currently has only two students, we can add more.

 




### Adding Students

Supply the neccessary information so that you can add the student and save it to the text file.
 <!--add image showing two students-->

We can always add more
<!-- add 2 image showing adding students and many students -->

### Editing 

You can edit by supplying the Student ID of the student you want to edit
<!-- add image showing edit-->

As you can see, the information that is shown is now different after the edit is done.
<!-- add after edit image-->

### Deleting

You can also delete all the data of a certain student by.
Just enter the Student ID of the student you want to delete.

<!--show 2 images before and after delete image-->
***

## Sorting
***
You can sort the data by Student ID, Surname, Firs Name, Birth Date , and Sex.

You can choose whether you want it to be ascending or desceding order.


An example of sorting by Surname in Ascending order.

<!-- Show before and after image of sorting image-->


You can also try it with other categories

***

## Filter

You can also use filter to filter out the students you want to display.

Entering the category and keyword so that it will only display the student that satisfies the requirements.

<!-- show example of sort-->
